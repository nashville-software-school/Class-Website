After college I worked as both a Park Ranger and as a Zookeeper. In both positions I often found myself being more technologically interested than my colleagues and was usually the one to fix old electronics and troubleshoot new equipment. I welcomed the idea of  sensors and programs that could automate the work for us and we could monitor those systems adjusting parameters to make them work as efficiently as possible. This interest followed me everywhere, I taught myself about most of what I know about computers in my free time and love making tech projects at home too. When I started grabbing code from Github and learning that I could write code too, I knew then that I wanted to make a career switch. My goal as a Software Developer is to design applications for the future and to increase the efficiency in our lives both time and energy, while mitigating the loss of our natural resources.</p>",

I started with C++ in highschool and dabbled with a bit of other languages since then. In colelge, I used Prolog for a computational linguistics course where we drove robotic cars using our voice. Due to health reasons after graduating, I could no longer do Peace Corp on medical grounds, so I continued learning at a local community college and state school. Doing so taught me to plan, build, and automate tools which eased my workload in the transportation/logistics/freight shipping industries. It was not until I was laid off in December of 20200, that I decided to return from my hobby hiatus and enrolled at the Nashville Software School. NSS reinforced my skillset and taught me to use the latest technologies. In my free time I like to catch up on (computational) linguistics, explore, and volunteer, particularly with the homeless. I look forward to collaborating with you on future endeavors.</p>",

My interest in web development stemmed greatly from the need of building my own website for my music career (and never being satisfied with the “status quo” website templates); also, I saw a glaring gap in private music teachers and music organizations having a functional up to date website. Often times I would tell myself, “You should figure out how to do this…” but then scoff at the idea. When I finally succumbed to my intuition pulling me to this path, I started to dabble on my own with coding classes online and found myself very intrigued. From that moment, I decided to give coding my best effort by attending a coding bootcamp. That decision led me to NSS. Several friends and former colleagues of mine attended NSS and spoke highly of the program. I have gathered hands on knowledge and training in many different coding languages at NSS, such as: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Python, SQL, and Django. I am excited to begin my career as a professional junior web developer and will be graduating from NSS on June 25th, 2021.
