# Class Website Template Repo

This is a simple template for NSS students to use to create their class website. Employers are looking for a simple website where they can easily see each students' quick summary and links to Github, LinkedIn, and website. Your class website should look nice and professional, but no need to get fancy. ;)

## To get started on the class website

1. Clone repo
1. Update `data/cohort.json` with student information
1. Update images with your class's photos
1. Update `data/tech.json` with your cohort's tech stack
1. Change anything else with styling you'd like!
1. Make it awesome

## To Deploy

Deploy to Github Pages - no need for a custom domain.

Mandy will then take your Github Pages URL and set up a redirect link - that redirect link is what employers will get (example: [www.nashss.com/cohort28](www.nashss.com/cohort28)).
